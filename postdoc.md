title: Expectations

---

It is my goal that all members of my lab will succeed in the lab and in the future. I am interested in postdocs who are planning careers both in and outside of academia so long as our research interests and goals overlap.

I expect the following from postdocs:

- plan to publish 3 papers per year (one first author)
- maintain data and code such that it could be used by others in the lab
- provide regular updates on your progress
- train and mentor graduate and undergraduate students

In return, you can expect the following from me:

- weekly meetings to make sure you are progressing
- assistance with writing, programming, and career skills
- assistance in applying for funding (grands and fellowships)
- opportunities to discuss future career goals and ways to facilitate these goals
- recommendation letters
