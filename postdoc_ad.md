POSTDOC POSITION IN PHYLOGENOMICS AND/OR GENOME EVOLUTION

A Postdoctoral Research Associate position is available in the new Schwartz lab (http://rachelss.github.io) in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Rhode Island. The lab is focused on understanding evolutionary history using large genomic datasets, and developing methods and software for researchers interested in empirical questions. A successful candidate will work on projects related to genotype calling from high-throughput error-prone sequencing data, efficient ortholog finding from these data, identification of paralogous genes, and evaluation of the characteristics of phylogenetically informative data.  These methods will be incorporated into the software SISRS (https://github.com/rachelss/SISRS), for finding phylogenetically informative data without a reference genome. The postdoc will also have some flexibility to develop new projects related to their own interests, and opportunities for collaboration at URI and elsewhere.

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS: 

- PhD in bioinformatics, computational biology, biostatistics, genomics, molecular biology or related fields
- Experience in scientific computing and programming/scripting languages in UNIX platforms (e.g. Bash, Python, R)
- Expertise in phylogenetics, population genetics, or similar
- Record of publication

DESIRED QUALIFICATIONS AND SKILLS:

- Experience in processing and analyzing high-throughput sequencing 
- Experience in development/maintenance of scientific software
- Experience in statistical analysis and method development
- Experience in high-performance parallel computing

START DATE AND DURATION: Preferred start date is ASAP. Funding is initially for one year, with renewal for an additional year pending satisfactory performance. Continued renewal will depend on funding and performance.

APPLICATIONS: Send a cover letter, your CV, and the names and contact information for three references to Rachel Schwartz at rsschwartz@uri.edu. The cover letter should describe why you are interested in this job, your relevant experience, and your research / career goals. Review of applications will begin immediately
and will continue until a strong candidate is hired.
