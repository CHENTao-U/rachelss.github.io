title: Expectations

---

It is my goal that all members of my lab will succeed in the lab and in the future. Thus, you can expect the following from me:

- weekly meetings to make sure you are progressing
- assistance in learning necessary skills (writing, programming, etc.)
- help with writing (manuscripts and fellowship applications)
- opportunities to discuss future career goals and ways to facilitate these goals
- recommendation letters
- funding for research assistantships when possible

In return I expect the following from students:

- weekly meetings to provide an update on your progress
- maintain data and code such that it could be used by others in the lab
- one presentation per semester on your research in lab meeting
- assistance in training undergraduate and new students
- open communication with me about whether the research you are doing holds your interest
