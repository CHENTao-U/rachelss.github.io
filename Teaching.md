## Philosophy

All of my pedagogical strategies are dedicated to teaching the analytical skills required across all scientific disciplines, as well as fundamental concepts in biology.
I employ active, inquiry-based approaches that link studentsâ€™ experiences inside and outside the classroom so that these skills and knowledge will remain with them long after they graduate.
In my classes students develop inquiry skills using real data; this process encourages them to think and allows them to be real scientists.
I assign readings and exercises that emphasize the relevance of concepts to life, and teach core skills needed to analyze data effectively and efficiently.
