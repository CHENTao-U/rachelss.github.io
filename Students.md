### Prospective Postdocs
I have funding available for a postdoctoral researcher. If you are interested in working with me, please contact me by email. Postdocs must have a Ph.D. in hand before the start date. I welcome contact well prior to completion of a Ph.D. to plan for the following year and/or postdoc fellowship applications.

### Prospective Graduate Students

If you are interested in working with me, please contact me by email as early as possible. Prospective students should plan to visit in the fall. The deadline for the receipt of completed applications is January 15 for admission to the Fall semester. I accept MS and PhD students through the Biological and Environmental Sciences graduate program (http://web.uri.edu/cels-gradprograms/bes/) in the College of the Environement and Life Sciences, with specialization in Integrative and Evolutionary Biology (http://web.uri.edu/cels-gradprograms/ieb/) or Cell and Molecular Biology (http://web.uri.edu/cels-gradprograms/cmb/). Support is available through TA and RA positions.

Some tips on contacting me:

- Please read this website and my papers before contacting me. Know that you are interested in working in my area of research. If your email states a vague interest such as "bioinformatics" or "evolution" it significantly reduces the chances I'll write back.

- Please let me know your research interests. I want to work with people who have their own ideas and goals. 

- Show me you have the potential to do well in graduate school. This means you can communicate well in your email, you have done research as an undergraduate (so you know that's what you want to do for 2-5 years), and you work hard.

- Send your C.V. or resume. It helps me to see your experience. If you don't know what a C.V. should look like, look at mine. You don't have to have extensive experience, but I want to see you've been working toward graduate school and research.

### Undergraduates

If you are an undergraduate interested in working in my lab, please read the research page and the following expectations and responsibilities, then email me (1) your resume, (2) your transcript,Â and (3) one page or less describing your research interests and course background.

My responsibilities to my undergraduate students: 
Meet with you weekly.
Prepare a "real" project that helps you learn.
Assist with learning necessary skills (e.g. git, command line, coding)
Edit manuscripts.
Discuss future career goals and plan ways to facilitate these goals.
Write recommendation letters (after you have been working in the lab for at least one semester).
Provide comments on fellowship / graduate school applications.
Pay / provide academic credit when possible depending on your contribution to my research.

Expectations of my undergraduate students:
