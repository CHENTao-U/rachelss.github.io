I am currently an Assistant Research Scientist in the [Cartwright Lab](http://cartwrig.ht/) in  the [Biodesign Institute](http://www.biodesign.asu.edu/) of [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu/). Previously I was a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in Bioinformatics in the [Mueller Lab](http://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/muellerlab/Home.html) in the Department of Biology at Colorado State University.

My research focuses on developing computational methods to tools to apply genomic data to biological questions, usually related to evolution.
